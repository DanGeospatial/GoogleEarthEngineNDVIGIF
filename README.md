# GoogleEarthEngineNDVIGIF
A short script for creating GIFs in GEE that show NDVI changes over time.

To use this script all you need to do is enter your region, continent in the mask function and date range. 
Be aware that changing the settings to include too many frames will run into performance limits. Especially the 'framesPerSecond', 'dimensions' and 'doy'.

This is originally designed for NDVI but you can select other bands and adjust the visualization parameters.

#TODO
- improve performance / update methods
- add timestamps
